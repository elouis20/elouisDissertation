# SREC - Stochastic Robustness Evaluation and Categorization 
Method to support robust systems design in high-dimensional, multi-failure mode simulation models with aleatory uncertainty by "tagging" inputs that cause system performance to fail to meet design requirements. Tagged inputs are used to construct subsets that are then used to categorize the input space and quantify the robustness of a system.

Implemented in MATLAB
